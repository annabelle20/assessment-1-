                        <article>
                               <p>My interest in IT began when I was in my final year of high school in 2004. I remember my mind being blown when my friend showed me her iPod. I could not believe a tiny machine could hold up to 10,000 songs, which was a far cry from my chunky discman that would skip with the slightest movement.
                        My interest and curiosity in the IT world increased to new levels when I became a high school teacher and was astounded by all the cool things my kids were being taught and how clever they were on their ipads.  I decided to take a leap of faith and jump into another university degree. RMIT was a great fit for me as I am a new mum to a baby boy, so having the flexibility to study in the comfort of my home and choose my study hours helps me juggle new mum life. I have a little bit of IT experience where I implemented different programs and apps into my lesson planning in the classroom, however I am still a novice in the IT world. Throughout this degree I expect to lay the foundations of Information Technology and advance my future career in programming.

                        <article>
                                <p>My ideal job is a software developer. After reviewing various positions on Seek, my attention was drawn to the IT company, One point Australia. This career opportunity offered the successful applicant the chance to join a team that was focussed on becoming a key player in the digital transformation and had 2,500 employees across the globe. This was intriguing as there was opportunity to work in my desired field and work overseas.  The role requires the applicant to be involved in all areas of the software development and to create and maintain a wide array of software solutions across multiple technologies encompassing both analysis and design aspects whilst coding solutions within a full-stack environment. The qualifications required are 3 yearsâ€™ experience with objected oriented programming, front end development and modern JS frameworks (React, Angular), familiarity with back-end development (C#, Java, NodeJs) and exposure to Cloud/DevOps. Further possess excellent written and verbal communication skills, ability to trouble shoot, be at team player and have analytical problem-solving skills.  </p>
        
                                <h3> Skills I have</h3>
                                <p>At present I have the necessary interpersonal skills, excellent verbal and written communication and have a solution based mindset approach when faced with problems. These skills were acquired from my teaching career where I was constantly involved in team dynamics depending on the year level I was teaching or planning lessons for. With these skills I can state that I was able to teach effectively to a diverse range of learners. In terms of obtaining the technical skills I will endeavour to immerse myself in my upcoming subjects that explore Java and Cloud/DevOps. To gain more experience I will set time to explore these areas in my own time and apply for graduate entry jobs once I finish my degree to gain industry exposure.  </p>
