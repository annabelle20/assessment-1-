                               <p>My interest in IT has always been one of marvel and admiration. The remarkable advancements IT have achieved so far in my lifetime are insane. I remember my mind being blown when I saw the first iPod being used at school. I could not believe a tiny machine could hold up to 10,000 songs, which was a far cry from my chunky discman that I sported with a scratch CD that would skip with the slightest movement.
                        My interest and curiosity in the IT world amped to new levels when I became a high school teacher as I was surrounded by all the cool stuff kids were being taught and what they would tell me about. From this curiosity I decided to take a leap of faith and jump into another university degree that is completely out of my comfort control. RMIT was a great fit for me as I am a new mum to a baby boy, so having the flexibility to study in the comfort of my home and choose my study hours helps me juggle new mum life. I have a little bit of IT experience utilizing different programs and apps in the classroom, however I am still a novice in this world. Throughout this degree I expect to lay the foundations of Information Technology and advance my future career in programming.</p>
